## FABLAB
**MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING**
A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.

A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make "almost anything".[3] This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.The fab lab movement is closely aligned with the DIY, the open source hardware and the free and open source movement, and shares philosophy as well as technology with them.
